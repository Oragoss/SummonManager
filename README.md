# SummonManager
A neat summon handling tool!

# What is it?
This is a tool for players and DMs to help keep track of all their summons. We all enjoy the tactile feeling of rolling dice, but sometimes it just becomes too much to keep track of everything. This tool will greatly speed up your combat!

# Uses
Say you're a Circle Of The Shepherd druid and you summon 8 wolves. You can roll 8 attack roll die (even all at once!) then add their hit chance to each roll. Then you have to roll the damage for each one that hit, after you find out which ones hit. It all takes up a lot of time.
